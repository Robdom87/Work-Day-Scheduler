# Work Day Scheduler

## Description
The Work Day Scheduler is a simple app to organize a person's schedule. It is divided into two sections: header, and the time sections.

The header consists of the title of the site and provides todays date in (Weekday, Month Day) format.

The time section consists of 9 hour blocks from 9 AM to 5 PM representing a normal workday. The blocks formatting will change depending on the time of day with grey, red, and green blocks represening past, present, and future respectively. The text area can be updated and the inputted text saved to the local drive by clicking the save button on the right side of the block.

At 12 AM, the saved events will be cleared out of the local drive to allows for events to ve scheduled for the new day.
